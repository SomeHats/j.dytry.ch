Look! I've got a new blog! And hey, there's a kitten! What more could you want?

I've got a couple of ideas for posts I want to write at some point. The one I'm working on right now is about how code comments are used in tools like Mozilla Thimble, and how we can make these more useful and accessible whilst maintaining a hackable learning experience.

For anyone who might care about the technical side of things, I'm trying to keep things pretty simple. I'm using [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) to generate the site. I wrote this little [Jekyll plugin](https://gist.github.com/4578938) to automatically convert my Stylus to CSS and Coffeescript to JS. It also supports Sass and Less, and will minify CSS and Javascript using YUIcompressor and Google's Closure Compiler, respectively. It optimises images using optipng and jpegtran.
